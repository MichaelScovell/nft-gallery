## NFT Gallery

### About the Project
This project served as an introduction into using the Alchemy API, specifically through calling the API to fetch and retrieve NFT's from the associated wallet and collection addresses. These fetched NFT's from the addresses were then displayed within a grid format, replicating that of a digital gallery.

This project followed the Alchmey Road to Web 3 Development projects:
